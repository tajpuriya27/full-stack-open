**<u>UNDERSTANDING QUESTION</u>**

**Sequence diagram** depicting the situation where user visits the page: https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes

```mermaid

    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css

    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes
```

Here, I have to create a sequence diagram depicting the situation where the user creates a new note on the page https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes by writing something into the text field and clicking the submit button.

I don't have to take an account of all rules while making [sequence diagram](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unified-modeling-language-uml-sequence-diagrams/). Sensible way of presenting the events is fine and comments on diagram is a plus point.

**<u>Solution:</u>**

> The sequence diagram below shows the events when user click on `save` button. Below figure doesnot includes the events user entering into the site https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note
    activate server
    note over server: redirects to: <br/> https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes
```
